###Start app

1 - Create app.js on the folder and, after that, call npm init on the terminal to create
the application package.

2 - Load up the modules you're willing to use by calling npm install --save <package_1> <package_n>...
Here is an example: npm install --save express mongoose path body-parser mongoose-hiden

2.1 - If you already have a package with a few dependencies, just type in npm install.
